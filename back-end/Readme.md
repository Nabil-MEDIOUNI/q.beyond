**Important note** When adding dependencies or updating them, use `yarn` and not `npm`

# Linting and formatting

- Uses ESLint and Prettier working in pair together
- Linting and formatting are enforced (won't compile unless addressed)
- Formatting/Linting is automatically processed on saving files. If linting errors remain unresolved, commit won't go through
- In fact, linting and formatting tasks are also
  installed as a pre-commit hook through Husky
  
# Committing code

- Follows the [_Conventional Committing_](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard

- Feature example: `git commit -m "feat: Closes ISS-1. Ability to login with Apple"`
- Patch example: `git commit -m "fix: Closes ISS-2 and corrects scrolling bug"`
- Major/Breaking change example: `git commit -m "BREAKING CHANGE: Updated website version"`
- Combines feature and breaking change:
- Major/Breaking change example:

  `git commit -m "feat: Closes ISS-1. Ability to login with Apple BREAKING CHANGE"`

- Commits not impacting versioning:

  - Regular / casual example: `git commit -m "chore: ISS-4 Installed dependencies"`
  - Refactoring example: `git commit -m "refactoring: Refactored component"`
  - Other commit types: _build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test_

- The standard is linted and Husky will prevent commits from going through if it's not compliant
- Appropriate tags based on the conventional commit history
